What Is a Virtual Environment?
A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries, and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed on the same Operating System. ‘virtualenv’ is a tool to create a unique and isolated environment for python projects on windows. It installs the packages we need that are unique to that setting while keeping your projects neatly organized.The other great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since they’re just directories containing a few scripts. Plus, they’re easily created using the virtualenv command-line tools.
